# The ANIMA Project

We present a novel computer application for real-time exploration and manipulation of microtonal harmonies through an intuitive interface visualization and integrated MIDI controllers, allowing real-time interaction and bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical musical applications. We investigate how modern harmonic principles can be applied and extended in the 53-tone equal temperament (53-TET) resolution, which facilitates a richer harmonic repertoire. Our approach starts from 12-TET modes disposition of standard functional chords, borrowing 31-TET principles that extend minor/major interval qualities with subminor, neutral, and supermajor distinctions. Subsequently, we extend to 53-TET's harmonic landscape with detailed interval qualities. Our application implements modal interchange techniques and parallel chord substitutions to offer a user access to parallel harmonic trajectories in microtonality. Our implementation employs MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) through a custom MaxForLive application called the Bridge that connects conventional MIDI protocols with the construction of 53-TET chords, allowing precise microtonal control while maintaining compatibility with modern digital audio workstations, using Ableton Live (11/12) as a platform. The application includes a real-time visualization system, interactive chord manipulation tools, and a comprehensive Scale Editor to explore novel harmonic structures and trajectories. We demonstrate through practical examples and theoretical analysis how the proposed approach enables discovering new harmonic possibilities while preserving meaningful connections to established modal frameworks. This research contributes to the growing microtonal music field by providing theoretical foundations and practical tools that incorporate extended tuning systems into contemporary musical practice.
